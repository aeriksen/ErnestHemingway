# ErnestHemingway
Ernst Hemingway quote program ;)

"EHquote" binary compiled with clang. 
To run binary, cd in to directory and type ./EHquote.

I'm thinking maybe GPLing it, maybe people will make it cooler (as if that's even possible).

You know what, ya'll can still contribute to a permissive lisence project (if you want).
